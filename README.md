<h1>Routing internet traffic through a pfSense firewall</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
For the setup, I have a domain controller, a pc and a firewall. These are their IPs:</br>
DC: 192.168.20.1</br>
PC: 192.168.20.2</br>
pfSense FW: 192.168.20.254</br>
</br>
The pc is connected to the DC and they both point to pfSense as the gateway. I configure pfSense to route the pc traffic to the internet.
